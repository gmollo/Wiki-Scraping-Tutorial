# Wiki-Scraping-Tutorial

## Preface
Recently, I worked on an assignment that required gathering data from diverse sources on the internet. A component of that entailed collecting data from tables embedded within wikipedia articles. As a result, I thought it was a good time to write a simple tutorial on data extraction from wikipedia using the web scraping package beautiful soup. 

### Keywords : [Web Scraping, Data Extraction ]
